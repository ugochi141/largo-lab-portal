2. Document all troubleshooting steps attempted

4. Notify Technical Quality Specialist with:
   * All troubleshooting steps performed
   * Tech support reference number

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

When All Automated Systems Are Down:
1. Assess situation: Determine expected downtime
2. Contact immediate support: Notify Laboratory Managers and Laboratory Directors with Service Reference number
3. Prioritize samples: Process STAT and urgent samples first
4. Use manual methods: Consider sending to reference lab or backup analyzer
5. Document everything: Keep detailed records of all actions
6. Call for help: Contact service representatives and managers
7. Communicate delays: Inform requesting physicians of delays

Contamination Incidents:
1. Immediate containment: Isolate affected area
2. Personal protection: Ensure staff safety with PPE
3. Stop testing: Halt all operations in affected area
4. Clean and disinfect: Use appropriate disinfectants
5. Contact support: Notify Laboratory Managers and Laboratory Directors
6. Document incident: Complete incident report
7. Restart procedures: Only after thorough decontamination

Power Failure Response:
1. Secure samples: Ensure proper storage temperature
2. Document time: Record exact time of power failure
3. Check emergency power: Verify backup systems operational
4. Preserve reagents: Maintain cold chain if possible
5. Contact support: Notify Laboratory Managers and Laboratory Directors
6. Recovery planning: Prepare for system restart procedures

IMPORTANT: Instrument Downtime or Issues Running Specimens
If the automated instruments are down or there are issues running a specimen, send to MOB lab or send to other regional laboratory with a working instrument. Use the alphabetical file to keep track of requisitions received.

LIS Downtime Operations
Error Message Management During LIS Downtime
Error messages on instruments when running patients during LIS downtime are acceptable because:
1. Expected behavior - The instruments are correctly detecting and reporting the loss of LIS connectivity
2. Operations can continue - Most modern laboratory instruments can operate in standalone mode
3. Results are preserved - Instruments store results locally in their internal memory during downtime
4. Downtime procedures activated - The error message serves as a clear indicator to follow downtime protocols
5. No actual malfunction - The error reflects a known, temporary communication issue
6. Recovery is straightforward - Once LIS connectivity is restored, stored results can be transmitted

High-Demand Laboratory Operations During Downtime
To maintain patient testing efficiency during LIS downtime:
* Continue testing on all instruments despite error messages
* Use manual logging to track all specimens tested
* Print instrument results immediately after testing
* Maintain chronological order of testing for proper recovery
* Communicate delays to requesting departments
* Prioritize STAT and urgent specimens
* Follow established downtime workflows to minimize disruption
