Action 4: Flag for HR review if pattern detected
```

### Flow 3: System Status Monitor
```

export NOTION_STAFFING_TRACKER_DB_ID="database_id"
# ... (add all database IDs)

# Run webhook handler
python scripts/notion_keyword_webhook.py
```

### Step 2: Configure Power Automate to Use Webhook
```
Action: HTTP POST
URL: https://your-server.com/webhook/keywords
Body: {
  "message": "@{triggerBody()['body']['content']}",
  "sender": "@{triggerBody()['from']['user']['displayName']}",
  "channel": "@{triggerBody()['channelData']['channel']['name']}",
  "timestamp": "@{utcNow()}"
}
```

## 📊 Phase 4: Dashboard Setup

4. Verify: Service ticket created
```

## 📈 Phase 6: Monitoring & Optimization

### Daily Monitoring Checklist

2. No Response (5 minutes): Escalate to supervisor + Additional SMS
3. No Response (10 minutes): Call department head + Page administrator  
4. No Response (15 minutes): Activate emergency response team
```

### System Failure Response
```
1. Immediate: Post system status update
2. Within 2 minutes: Contact IT/service provider
3. Within 5 minutes: Activate backup procedures
4. Ongoing: Regular status updates every 15 minutes
5. Resolution: Post-incident review and documentation
```
