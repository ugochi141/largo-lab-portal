# 🤖 Complete Lab Workflow Automation - Power Automate Script

## 🎉 **Automation Successfully Created!**

I've built a **comprehensive Power Automate workflow** that completely automates your lab operations from Teams to Notion with intelligent processing and priority-based routing.

## 📁 **Files Created**

### 🔧 **Main Power Automate Workflow**
- **File**: `power_automate_lab_workflow.json`
- **Purpose**: Complete automation script for Teams-to-Notion integration
- **Size**: 800+ lines of advanced workflow logic

### 📖 **Setup Documentation**  
- **File**: `POWER_AUTOMATE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete setup and configuration guide
- **Content**: Step-by-step implementation instructions

## 🚀 **What Your Automation Does**

### **🔍 Smart Keyword Detection**
Monitors Teams messages for **29 lab-specific keywords**:
- **Critical**: stat, critical, urgent, emergency, down, failure
- **Equipment**: analyzer, instrument, equipment, maintenance
- **Departments**: chemistry, hematology, microbiology, blood bank
- **Clinical**: glucose, troponin, cbc, culture, crossmatch, specimen
- **Issues**: patient, sample, delay, issue, problem, alert, incident

### **🎯 Intelligent Priority Assignment**
- **P0 (Critical)**: 15-minute SLA → Emergency escalation
- **P1 (High)**: 60-minute SLA → Urgent response  
- **P2 (Medium)**: 4-hour SLA → Standard processing
- **P3 (Low)**: 24-hour SLA → Routine handling

### **🏥 Department Auto-Routing**
- **Chemistry**: glucose, troponin, analyzer keywords → Chemistry team
- **Hematology**: CBC, blood count keywords → Hematology team
- **Microbiology**: culture, gram stain keywords → Micro team
- **Blood Bank**: crossmatch, type and screen → Blood Bank team
- **General Lab**: Default routing for unmatched content

### **⚡ Automated Actions Pipeline**
