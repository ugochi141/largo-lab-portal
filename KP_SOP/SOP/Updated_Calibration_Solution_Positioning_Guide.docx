CALIBRATION SOLUTION POSITIONING GUIDE

HORIZONTAL REAGENT RACK LAYOUT

Position 1: Negative Control (5.0 mL)
Position 2: Positive Control (5.0 mL)  
Position 3: Calibrator Low (10 mL)
Position 4: Calibrator High (10 mL)
Position 5: Wash Solution (15 mL)
Position 6: Diluent (20 mL)

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

• Position tubes in the horizontal rack from left to right, starting with position 1
• Ensure all tubes are properly seated and secure in their positions
• Verify reagent volumes match the specified amounts shown above each tube
• Check expiration dates on all reagents before use
• Maintain proper storage temperatures for all solutions

NOTE: This horizontal rack design matches the automated urine analyzer control panel layout. The rack positioning starts with tube #1 on the left and progresses sequentially to the right. Each tube shows the appropriate volume and reagent type for proper analyzer operation.

QUALITY CONTROL:

• Run negative control (Position 1) before each batch
• Run positive control (Position 2) to verify system functionality
• Use calibrators (Positions 3-4) for instrument calibration as needed
• Ensure wash solution (Position 5) is fresh and uncontaminated
• Replace diluent (Position 6) according to manufacturer recommendations
