## QC Failure Actions

### ⚠️ Critical QC Rule

**NEVER report patient results if QC is not acceptable.**

Patient safety depends on accurate results. If QC fails:
1. Troubleshoot and repeat
2. If still failing, use backup method or send to reference lab

### QC Failure Troubleshooting Steps

When QC fails, follow these steps IN ORDER:

1. **Repeat QC analysis**
2. **Check reagent expiration dates**
3. **Inspect instrument for problems**
4. **Contact manager if QC continues to fail**
5. **Do NOT report patient results until QC is acceptable**

### Follow-up Notification Requirements

1. **Immediately notify Lead Technologist, TQS, and management** of QC failure. Proceed to troubleshooting.
2. **Document all troubleshooting steps attempted**
3. **Contact Tech Support and obtain reference number**
4. **Notify Technical Quality Specialist with:**
   - All troubleshooting steps performed
   - Tech support reference number (add to Handoff Sheet)
   - Current instrument status
5. **Notify Laboratory Manager** with complete documentation

**CRITICAL:** Before contacting Technical Quality Specialist and Lab Manager, ensure you have:
- Documented all troubleshooting steps
- Obtained the reference number from Tech Support

**DO NOT leave it for next shift** - must troubleshoot and contact tech support, then pass down to next shift.

## ⚡ QC Failure Action Plan Algorithm

### Step-by-Step Response to QC Failure

**Step 1: STOP**
- Do not report patient results

**Step 2: EVALUATE**
Determine error type:
- **Random error** → Repeat QC immediately
- **Systematic error** → Proceed to troubleshooting

**Step 3: TROUBLESHOOT**
Follow systematic approach:
- Check for obvious issues (reagent expiration, probe clogs)
- Review recent changes (maintenance, reagent lots)
- Run fresh control material
- Check calibration status

**Step 4: DOCUMENT**
Record all actions:
- QC failure details
- Troubleshooting steps performed
- Root cause identified
- Corrective action taken

**Step 5: VERIFY**
Confirm resolution:
- Run QC to verify acceptable performance
- If using backup method, verify correlation

**Step 6: NOTIFY**
Communication requirements:
- **Lead Technologist** - Immediately
- **Technical Support** (if needed) - Get reference number
- **Technical Quality Specialist** - With documentation
- **Laboratory Manager** - Complete report

**Step 7: RESUME**
Return to testing:
- Only after QC passes
- Review any held patient samples
- Consider repeat testing if indicated

## Pre-QC Workflow Steps

**This workflow applies to:**
- Pure Analyzer 1
- Pure Analyzer 2
- All QC runs
- All calibrations
- All maintenance procedures

**Remember:** Print → Verify → Run → Document

### Step 1: Print QC Load List

Before running QC, calibration, or maintenance on either Pure Analyzer, you **MUST first print out a QC Load List**.

### Step 2: Navigate to Pre-Routine

Access the Pre-Routine menu and check the following items in Reagent Management List:

- ✓ Download Required Items
- ✓ Sample Records Management
- ✓ Recommend Calibration
- ✓ Routine QC
- ✓ Standby QC (New Lot Only)
- ✓ Calibrator and QC Load List
- ✓ Update SW Components

### Step 3: Print Routine QC

In the Routine QC section, ensure you print the report.

### Step 4: Calibrator and QC Load List

- Check both boxes
- Select "Confirm"

### Step 5: Verify Reagent Lots

Once the QC Load List is printed:

1. Compare the reagent lots on the analyzer to the lots listed on the printout
2. Check if reagents need a new bottle or are a new lot
3. **IMPORTANT:** Notify the Lead Tech or Shanti immediately about any lots that are in use but not entered in the system

### Step 6: Documentation

**MANDATORY:** Attach the QC Load List to the shift handoff form

## Oncoming Shift Priorities

### 🧑‍🔬 Oncoming Techs

**Priority 1:** Check all daily, weekly, and monthly QC/Maintenance logs and Cerner for completion and accuracy (2nd Reviewer duties apply).

**Priority 2:** Confirm QC/Temp logs are filed in the binder. Check inventory and ensure equipment is prepped for the shift.

**Priority 3:** In Pre-Routine check:
- Reagent Management List
- Download Required Items
- Sample Records Management
- Recommend Calibration
- Routine QC
- Standby QC (New Lot Only)
- Calibrator and QC Load List
- Update SW Components

In Routine QC make sure to **print**.

In Calibrator and QC Load List:
- Check both boxes
- Select confirm

Once the QC Load List is printed:
- Compare the reagents lot to the lot listed
- Notify Lead Tech or Shanti about any lots not entered but are in use

**Make sure to Attach the QC Load list to the shift handoff form. This is MANDATORY.**

For both Pure 1 and Pure 2 QC, Calibration, and Maintenance:
1. Print the sheet prior to starting QC
2. Check the lots on the reagents (check reagent needs a new bottle or is new lot)
3. Then run QC and Maintenance

## Daily QC & Compliance Practices

### Required Pre-Test QC

Techs must ensure:
- **SQA QC is done before patient testing**
- **Previ QC is completed daily**
- SQA QC must be scanned into the instrument
- The tech assigned to the MOB must complete daily Previ QC

### Zero Tolerance for Shortcuts

**There is to be NO:**
- Skipping QC
- Faking QC
- Forging QC and Maintenance records

**This is a serious compliance violation.**

### QC Failure Protocol (MOB)

If QC or validation fails before 11:00 a.m. (Pure 1 or Sysmex XN):
- Chemistry Testing should be redirected to AUC for patient testing
- Hematology Testing should be redirected to AUC for patient testing

|----------|-------|------------------------|
| AUC | Evening | Sysmex XN Shutdown (Saturday evening) |
