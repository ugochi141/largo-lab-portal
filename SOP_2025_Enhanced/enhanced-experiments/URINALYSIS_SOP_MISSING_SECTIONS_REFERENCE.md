## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:

### Option 1: Manual Copy-Paste (RECOMMENDED)
1. Open source file in browser
2. Copy each section's HTML
3. Insert into target file at appropriate locations
4. Test rendering in browser
5. Update table of contents

### Option 2: Selective Addition
1. Add only CRITICAL sections (13, 14, 15)
2. Add HIGH priority sections (12, 17, 24)
3. Enhance existing Section 10 with detailed QC
4. Update numbering and TOC

### Option 3: Create Supplement Document
1. Keep current file as-is
2. Create separate "Urinalysis_SOP_Procedures_Supplement.html"
3. Reference supplement in main SOP
4. Easier to maintain, smaller file sizes

---

## FILE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS:

**Source File:** 8.5 MB (contains large embedded images)
**Target File:** 88 KB (more concise)

**If adding all content:**
- Target file will grow to ~2-3 MB
- May contain duplicate embedded images
- Consider compressing images or using external references
