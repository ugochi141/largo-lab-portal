# 🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

## Files Just Opened
- **Debug_Scheduler.html** - Should auto-run diagnostics

## What to Check in Browser Console (Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I)

### 1. Debug_Scheduler.html Output
Look for these sections in the console:
- ✅ **Step 1: localStorage Access** - Should show "localStorage is accessible"
- 📦 **Step 2: Stored Data** - Shows what's in localStorage
- 🧪 **Step 3: Daily Schedule Integration** - Tests if Daily Schedule data is correct
- 🧪 **Step 4: Scheduler1 Integration** - Tests if Call Out Tracker data is correct
- 📋 **Step 5: Raw Data View** - Shows actual stored data

### 2. Critical Questions to Answer:

**Question 1:** Is there ANY data in localStorage?
- Look for: `dailyScheduleData`, `callOutScheduleData`, or `visualScheduleData`
- If NO → Problem is in Schedule Manager upload/extraction
- If YES → Continue to Question 2

**Question 2:** What dates are stored?
- Look for: "Found X date(s)" and "Dates: 2025-10-03, ..."
- Should see 2025-10-03 if you uploaded 100325 Schedule.jpg
- If NO → Date extraction failed in Schedule Manager

**Question 3:** What's the data structure?
- **dailyScheduleData** should be: `{"2025-10-03": {phleb: [...], lab: [...]}}`
- **callOutScheduleData** should be: `{"2025-10-03": [...]}`
- If structure is wrong → Problem in Schedule Manager data generation

**Question 4:** Do the fields match what schedulers expect?
- Check for: `name`, `nickname`, `shift`, `breaks`, `startTime`
- For lab: `dept`, `assignment`
- For phleb: `role`

## Next Steps Based on Results:

### If localStorage is EMPTY:
1. Go to Schedule_Manager_Enhanced.html
2. Upload 100325 Schedule.jpg again
3. Check browser console for OCR extraction logs
4. Click "Update Daily Schedule" button
5. Click "Update Call Out Tracker" button
6. Verify localStorage has data using Debug_Scheduler.html

### If localStorage HAS DATA but schedulers don't show it:
1. Open Daily Schedule.html
2. Check console for:
   - "🔍 [Daily Schedule] Checking localStorage..."
   - "📊 [Daily Schedule] dailyScheduleData: ..."
   - "📅 [Daily Schedule] Dates found: ..."
3. Open Scheduler1.html (Call Out Tracker)
4. Check console for:
   - "🔍 [Call Out Tracker] Checking localStorage..."
   - "📊 [Call Out Tracker] callOutScheduleData: ..."

### If data structure is wrong:
1. The issue is in Schedule Manager's data generation
2. Check `parseScheduleHTML()` function
3. Check `generateVisualDataObject()` function

## Quick Test with Load Test Data Button:
1. In Debug_Scheduler.html, click "📥 Load Test Data"
2. This bypasses OCR and loads sample data directly
3. Then refresh Daily Schedule.html and Scheduler1.html
4. If they work NOW → Problem is in OCR/image extraction
5. If they still don't work → Problem is in scheduler code

## Report Back:
Copy the console output from Debug_Scheduler.html and paste it so we can diagnose the exact issue.
